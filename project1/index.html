				<p class="variablep" style= "margin-left: 1000px;">Frank Henry Willard was born on September 21, 1893,
					in Anna, Illinois, the son of a physician.
					He determined to become a cartoonist early in life.
					After attending the Academy of Fine Arts in Chicago in 1913,
					he was a staff artist with the Chicago Herald (1914–18),
					where he drew the Sunday kids' page Tom, Dick and Harry and another strip,
					Mrs. Pippin's Husband. He next wrote and drew
				 	The Outta Luck Club for King Features Syndicate (1919–23). </p>

					 <p class="story">Moon was a tough-talking, if generally good natured, kind of guy who took (and dealt) plenty of punches during his run. And actually, those are very appropriate characteristics. See, back before Moon was created, Frank Willard was working on a strip called The Outta Luck Club for King Features Syndicate. That's when he got the notion that some of his ideas were being slipped to fellow cartoonist George McManus (creator of Bringing Up Father). So, in typical Moon 			Mullins fashion, Willard approached McManus and gave him a wallop that knocked the latter out cold and got the former fired. That little episode didn't stop Captain Joe Patterson's interest from being piqued, however, and Willard soon set to work on a new strip for the Chicago Tribune Syndicate. That strip was Moon Mullins...
Ah, Moon Mullins! He made a horrible role model but a hilarious star nonetheless—as did his assorted pals... Adventures included stints in jail, trysts with stolen cars, failed employment opportunities, misunderstandings and plenty of black eyes for all. Yet, there was a certain lightness to all of Moon's debaucheries that made his low-down ways pretty charming...[2]</P>
